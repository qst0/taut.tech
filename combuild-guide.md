## Fuel Source:

User creates something. User shares creation.

## Goal:

Build a platform in which a user wants to create and then share her creation.

## Some Tips:

### Don’t create a new community.
Creating a new community around a topic that doesn’t have conversations or forum presence online is really really tough and I would not recommend it.
I once launched a site where bar owners could share their drink-list and happy hours. It didn’t go well because I couldn’t find any conversations to join to share my product once it was done.
Before you start building, find the community, and understand their needs. Your aim should be to “grease-out” and create structure on the things they’re already doing.
Don’t create a new community, grow an existing one.

### Single Player > Multi Player
Build a solid single player game before making it multiplayer.
Whatever it is you’re building, there should be value even if the size of the community is one.
A great example is PCPartPicker, which helps users build their PC by comparing part prices and compatibility.
You should aim for 50% tools / 50% community.

### Exporting, embedding, social media.
Everything the users creates should be easily exportable or embedded in other platforms.
You should especially make sure to make it sharable in the platform the community was previously using to talk to each other.

### Fake it, ethically.
During the first month of launch, I suggest generating content on behalf of other users. You can accomplish this by creating an admin account and manually adding content posted on other platforms.
For example, for YugiDecks, if someone posted a decklist on the /r/DuelLinks subreddit, I would add it to YugiDecks and post the embedded deck list on the Reddit comments.
IMPORTANT: You need to give credit to the original creator in your website. Inform the creator that if she creates an account on your site, you can transfer the content to them. Most will grateful for having done the heavy lifting for them.

### Monetize from the get-go.
If you love your creation and you’re not a gazillionare or genius programmer, don’t aim for “free”. Building a community takes a lot of time and investment. Its survivability requires your full attention and if it gets big enough, paying for servers is a thing.
MVP should mean Minimum Viable Profit.
Whether it’s ads, affiliate links, or premium membership, monetization should be set or at least organized before launch.

### Creator = Consumer. Treat them equally.
Don’t make the experience different for the creator vs. consumer.
For example, don’t create a separate login screen unless you really need to.
It’s more often than not that the creator target market is exactly the same as the consumer target market.
