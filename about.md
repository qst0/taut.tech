We are making a community for learning to build a community, one tech at a time!

[Join us on our slack](https://publicslack.com/slacks/taut-tech/invites/new) as we hack away!

We set up our Github pages, using the [jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) tutorials.

We have our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TautTech) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Taut.tech/) live too!

# Let's learn!
