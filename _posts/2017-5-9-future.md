title: What's the future of Taut.tech?

After the rush of the hackathon and the energy you get when you start something new,
it can feel like it's all down hill from that peak. I want to let you know it does not have to be.

We are here for you on our site via Disqus, Slack and want to open up more channels for communication.
As I keep working on the idea behind Taut.tech I'll be writing tutorials and detailing the content we already have.

I want to start with a "post-mortem" and explain what worked, what didn't work, and how we would do it again but better.
Stay tuned, and feel free to join the converstation below, on slack or even find us in person!
