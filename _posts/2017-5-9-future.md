title: What's the future of Taut.tech?

After the rush of starting something new,
it can feel like it's all down hill from that peak.
We want to let you know it does not have to feel that way.

We are here for you on our site via Disqus, Slack and want to open up more channels for communication.
As I keep working on the idea behind Taut.tech I'll be writing tutorials and detailing the content we already have.

If you are looking for new content, we have a new page about [community building](http://taut.tech/combuild-guide/) that we didn't have last weekend. Thanks to bingle_dunderberry of [yugidecks.com](https://yugidecks.com), who joined our Slack!

I want to start with a "post-mortem" and explain what worked, what didn't work, and how we would do it again but better.

Update: [post-mortem is live here](/post-mortem)

Stay tuned, and feel free to join the converstation below, on slack or even find us in person!
