[#HackHarassment](https://www.hackharassment.com/) Take the pledge to stop online Harassment!

Hack Harassment is a coalition of organizations and individuals
who share in the common goal of building a more inclusive and
supportive online community. Hack Harassment does not guarantee
the world will be free from online harassment, but together,
we hope to bring us all closer to that goal.

Want to ask us how we feel about online harassment? Need help?

Talk to us. We are here to help.
