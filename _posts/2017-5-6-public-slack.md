------------------------
[Public Slack](https://publicslack.com/) is a great way start an open community!

This tool allows you to open your slack to the public by sharing your API key with their app.

Once you create a slack, you can make at this location. [https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)

You can always choose to make your community invite only or use the other settings slack has.

[Join us on our slack](https://publicslack.com/slacks/taut-tech/invites/new) as we create our learning community!
