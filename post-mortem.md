So now that the Hackathon is over, it's time to reflect on what we learned.

## What worked?

* Our site is running, you are reading content from it right now. That is a win.
* We connected and shared the idea with people at the hackathon.
* We even had someone say that they would use the product to get ideas for their community.

## What didn't?

* The idea wasn't as strong as I thought it was.
* Not technical enough
* Not inline with the goals of the Hackathon Sponsors

What was missing from the details or material might come into play.

Each post could be elaborated on, and the site could be friendlier.

I also feel that with IBM and the hardware that was provided and the goals set,
we could have focused on using watson or a technology they encouraged.

Let's talk about how we presented taut.tech

We can provide the materials for you to read or modify.
TODO: add slide deck

Update: Almost a week later, and Team Taut still needs to meet up!

Be sure if you go to a hackathon, stay in touch with the people you work with
