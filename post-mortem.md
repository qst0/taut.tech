So now that the Hackathon is over, it's time to reflect on what we have.

## What worked?

* Our site is running, you are reading content from it right now. That is a win.
* We connected and shared the idea with people at the hackathon.
* We even had someone say that they would use it, or something like it.

## What didn't?

* The idea wasn't as strong as I thought it was.
* Not technical enough
* Not inline with the goals of the Hackathon

What was missing from the details or material might come into play.

I also feel that with IBM and the hardware that was provided and the goals set, we could have focused on something 


Let's talk about how we presented taut.tech

We can provide the materials for you to read or modify.

Just have to sleep some now that it's all over...
